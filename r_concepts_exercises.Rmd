v2 <- c("M","M","F","F","M","M","F","F","M","F")
v3 <- c("Ottawa","Ottawa","Montreal","Vancouver","Toronto","Halifax","Toronto","Calgary","Montreal","Toronto")

Exercise 4: Half of the individuals have been assigned a treatment, and another half a placebo. Add a column of `logical` values called "treatment" using `cbind` or `cbind.data.frame`.

```{r Exercise 4}
v4 <- c(rep(TRUE,5), rep(FALSE,5))
```
